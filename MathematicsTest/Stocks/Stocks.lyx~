Galera Therapeutics Inc.
 is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company which focuses on developing
 and commercializing a pipeline of novel proprietary therapeutics that have
 the potential to transform radiotherapy in cancer.
 Their lead product candidate is avasopasem manganese (avasopasem, or GC4419),
 a selective small molecule dismutase mimetic in late-stage development
 to reduce the incidence and severity of radiotherapy-induced severe oral
 mucositis (SOM) in patients with head and neck cancer.
 Avasopasem is also in development for radiotherapy-induced esophagitis
 in patients with lung cancer.
 Avasopasem has been granted FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation
s for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy, with or without systemic
 therapy.
 Galera’s second dismutase mimetic product candidate, GC4711, is in clinical-sta
ge development to augment the anti-cancer efficacy of stereotactic body
 radiation therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and locally
 advanced pancreatic cancer.

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cellular therapies
 for chronic diseases associated with aging and other life-threatening condition
s.
 Our lead investigational product, Lomecel-B™, is derived from culture-expanded
 medicinal signaling cells (MSCs) isolated from the donated bone marrow
 of young healthy adults.
 These multipotent MSCs have special therapeutic properties, including homing
 to sites of inflammation and tissue damage, and stimulating tissue repair
 and organ maintenance, as well as modulation of immune system function.
 By harnessing these properties from allogeneic cells obtained from young
 healthy donors, our goal is to develop safe and effective cell therapy
 for some of the most difficult diseases and conditions associated with
 aging.

Our philosophy is that healthy aging can be achieved through regenerative
 medicine approaches.
 Life expectancy has substantially increased over the past century as a
 result of medical and public health advancements.
 However, this increase in longevity has not been paralleled by the number
 of years a person is expected to live in relatively good health, free of
 chronic disease and disabilities of aging – a period known as healthspan.
 As we age, we experience a profound decline, in both number and function,
 in our own MSCs, a decrease in immune system function, decline in blood
 vessel functioning, chronic inflammation and other issues.
 Our clinical data suggest that Lomecel-B™ addresses these conditions through
 multiple mechanisms of action, or MOAs, that simultaneously target key
 aging-related processes.

Note that Dare became a public company during the second quarter of 2017.
 They did so by merging with Cerulean Pharma (which was already a public

 The ticker $DARE used to be called $CERU before it was changed to $DARE
 after the merger.

My Comments

\begin_layout Standard
I am not very confident in Dare's sildenafil cream being succesful, as studies
 have shown that sildenafil citrate (viagra) does not seem to work for women.
 See this study here: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/152460902317586001.
 The reason it does not work for women seems to be related to the fact that
 sildenafil enhances the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway
 (NO-cGMP) involved in penile erection (thus seems to be related to men
 only).
 I would be very surprised if Dare meets their primary endpoints in the
 phase 2b trial for sildenafil cream.

I'm much more optimistic about theri product DARE-BV1, a thermosetting vaginal
 gel formulated with clindamycin phosphate 2% designed for prolonged, localized
 release of the antibiotic.
 Here are two reasons why I find this product very promising:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They met their primary endpoints in their phase 3 trial of DARE-BV1 and
 are planning on filing and NDA for 3Q 2021 (which will very likely be approved).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is an article from Eastern Virginia Medical School which discusses
 the positive results from that clinical trial.
 Here is a link to that article: https://www.evms.edu/pulse/archive/clinicalresear
chcenterseespositiveresultsinclinicaltrial.php.
 The article doesn't go into too much detail, but the fact that a respectable
 university has this on their website tells me that there are experts who
 seem pretty excited about this.
 Even better, the stock price shot up very fast a few days after this article
 was posted from January 15 to January 21.
 A google search shows that there was no obvious for why DARE increased
 in price during this time, but something which seems very related to this
 is that they participated in a fireside chat at the H.C.
 Wainwright BIOCONNECT 2021 Virtual Conference to be held January 11-14,
 2021.
 Thus it seems like investors were very interested in what DARE had to say
 at that event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another drug that Dare is developing (which is in the pre-clinical stage)
 is DARE-LARC1.
 The reason why this one is interesting is because on July 7, 2021 it was
 announced that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation granted DARE $48.95 million
 dollars for the development of its DARE-LARC1 product.

Overall, it seems like $DARE is a good long-term hold.
 At the moment, I own 30,000 shares of $DARE and its stock price right now
 is $1.55.
 Thus I have roughly $46k invested in $DARE at the moment.
 Here's my plan for now: I will 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
buy any more shares of $DARE unless the stock prices goes lower than $1.55
 (unless of course the stock price goes lower than $1.55 because of bad news).
 I do not plan on selling my shares anytime soon.
 At some point, my plans will surely change, and I will make updates to
 my plan at that time.

 The study did not meet Primary Endpoint of worst-itch NRS change from baseline
 at week 12 or Secondary Endpoint of 4-point responder analysis in the ITT
 patient population.
 The stock price tanked as a consequence of this news.
 Also on December 3rd 2019, Cara announced positive topline data from phase
 2 trial of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

For this PDUFA play, I would start a small position (~$10k).
 I would then add to that position only if I saw the stock price increase

 stock after the FDA approves it.
